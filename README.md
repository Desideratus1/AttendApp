What is this I don't even?

  Attendance App Group 8 Senior Design Spring 2017 Android App (Hopefully will son be IOS as well)
  All work done in this repository is done using Android Studio (latest verison as of 2/22/2017) using an emulator (First through Nexus 5 and later through KittyKat versions of Android phones. The distributions form the Android phones give the impression that using the KittyKat API 19 we will be able to run this app on ~75% of all android phones.
  
Where is everything?

  Java files containing the various Activities and other files are located within
  * AttendApp/app/src/main/java/attendApp/attendApp/
  
Confusing but unavoidable for now.
  Layout files are located in 
  * AttendApp/app/src/main/res/layout/
  
These contain the buttons, text fields etc. that dictate where each the various pieces of the activity are located.
  
Reference for the Java files
  LoginActivity.java is the first java file loaded into the program and its corresponding layout (login_layout) will be the first screen the user sees.
